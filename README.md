# DND_UI
User interface to quickly look up spells in Dungeons and Dragons 5e Players Handbook with a variety of search parameters.

I created this project as I had a hard time finding a good tool to do this for me and my friends to use in our own game. I also thought this would be a great way to practice SQL and postgres skills since searching for spells with specific criteria is very thematic for the querying of relational databases. Admittedly, using an SQL database is really not necessary but I wanted to practice.
